## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the content of the website on all screen sizes
- Consume content faster due to page routing
- View all office locations on google maps
- Contact the company via a functioning contact form
- View all portfolio projects through the dynamically rendered portfolio pages
- View a 404 page when a wrong link is accessed

## My process

### Built with

- React library
- Styled Components
- Advance use of Flexbox & CSS Grid for styling
- React Router => Rendering of pages
- React Helmet => Dynamic search engine optimization
- Technical SEO library
- FormSpree API => Sends contact form messages
- Figma => Interprete & view designs
- Vercel => CI/CD

### What I learned

This is a project I worked on to practice react and react routing. It was fun to build because I had the opportunity to experience how to build reusable and scalable web components like a professional despite the challenging design. It was a good learning experience!

### Continued development

I now understand why they say it can be difficult to add animations in React. Changes in state and the DOM make it quite tricky. It's something I'd like to delve in a little more going forward.
